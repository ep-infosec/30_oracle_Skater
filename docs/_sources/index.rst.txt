Model Interpretation with Skater
================================
Skater is a open source unified framework to enable Model Interpretation for all forms of model to help one build an
Interpretable machine learning system often needed for real world use-cases. Skater supports algorithms to
demystify the learned structures of a black box model both globally(inference on the basis of a complete data set)
and locally(inference about an individual prediction).

The package was originally developed by Aaron Kramer, Pramit Choudhary and rest of the DataScience.com team to
help data scientists and data enthusiast gain better model insight. Skater enables this vision by providing the
ability to infer and debug the model's decision policies as needed bringing "human in the loop".
